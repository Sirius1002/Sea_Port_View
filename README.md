# Sea_Port_View

Computer graphics project 3rd year
The "Seaport City View" project is an endeavor in computer graphics leveraging the OpenGL library and C++ programming language to create a visually immersive representation of a bustling urban environment centered around a seaport. This project encapsulates the foundational principles of graphics programming, encompassing the rendering of 2D elements such as buildings, roads, and water bodies, as well as the implementation of algorithms for drawing geometric shapes like circles. By harnessing OpenGL's capabilities, the project aims to simulate a dynamic and interactive cityscape, offering users a virtual experience of navigating through a vibrant seaport city setting.
